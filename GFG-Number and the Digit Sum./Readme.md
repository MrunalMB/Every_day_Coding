# Problem Statement

Given a positive integer N and another integer K, find the count of numbers smaller than or equal to N such that the difference between each number and the sum of its digits is greater than or equal to the given value K.

For example:
- If N = 13 and K = 2, the count of numbers satisfying the condition is 4: 10, 11, 12, and 13.
- If N = 10 and K = 5, only the number 10 satisfies the condition.

Your task is to implement the `numberCount()` function, which takes two integers `N` and `K` as inputs and returns the count of numbers less than or equal to N that fulfill the condition.


# Approach and Complexity Analysis

## Approach

The given problem aims to count the numbers smaller than or equal to N such that the difference between each number and the sum of its digits is greater than or equal to the given value K.

### Binary Search Approach

1. Initialize variables: `count`, `index`, `start`, and `end`.
2. Use a while loop to perform binary search within the range of 1 to N.
3. Within the loop:
    - Calculate the sum of digits for the current mid value.
    - Calculate the difference between the mid value and the sum of its digits.
    - Update the `start` or `end` based on the difference calculated.
4. Calculate the count of numbers satisfying the condition based on the final `start` value.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is logarithmic, O(log N), where N is the input value. The binary search algorithm efficiently narrows down the range of numbers, reducing the search space in each iteration.

## Auxiliary Space Complexity

The approach has constant auxiliary space complexity, O(1), as it uses a few variables (`count`, `index`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `org`, `sum`, `r`, `diff`) regardless of the input size. It does not require any additional space proportional to the input.

The binary search algorithm enables efficient searching without significant memory requirements.
